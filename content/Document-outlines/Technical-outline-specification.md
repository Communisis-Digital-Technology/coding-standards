The technical specification is a vital document in any piece of work which we undertake.  This document captures the technical requirements of the project delivery, giving explicit detail on the tools, technologies and infrastructure requirements of the build.

The chapter headings below are not all necessary for every project, but this should cover most eventualities.

This template should be filled in as information becomes available throughout the technical design process.

## Project overview

The functional specification will contain detailed description of the proposed project and it's workings and this SHOULD NOT be replicated in this document. However, it may be useful to have a brief overview of the project functions here.  you SHOULD write this from a technical perspective.  This section is optional where a functional specification exists.

### Key goals

Key business/technical goals of the project.

### Site map and summary

- Diagram of site map if available
- Estimation on number of templates
- Principle deliverables
- Main user journeys

### Known functions

This should NOT be the functional spec, but if there are any functions of the site which require a specific technical solution (e.g. social sharing) then list them out below.

## Technology stack

Communisis Digital approach every project with an agnostic view of the technology we will use to 

### Stack diagram and logical outline

This diagram is an abstract representation of the application, with it's logical components, links and dependencies clearly outlined, along with the required technologies to deliver against.  You can find an example here.

In addition, where relevant, provide a technology stack/infrastructure diagram.

For each element of the stack, please identify both the technology name and targeted version (e.g. PHP5).
