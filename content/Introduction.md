Welcome to the Communisis Digital coding standards knowledge base.  This is a community-maintainted reposititory of our coding standards and processes.  It is administered and maintained by the entire team here, and managed via Git.  You may build out static documentation from any of the snippets within this repository by compiling them [instructions here](#).

This knowledge base is built on Raneto, a Knowledgebase platform for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that uses static [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) files to power the knowledgebase.

For instructions on how to maintain this knowledge base, please refer to the README.md file within the git repository.

You can also download a PDF of the entire coding standards documentation.

These are general standards used as a baseline for our work.  Project specifc standards can be branched from this repository and held with the project documentation.
