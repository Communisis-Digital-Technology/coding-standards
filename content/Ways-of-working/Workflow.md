/* 
Title: Workflow
Sort: 3
*/

The project workflow determines how code should be produced.

Workflow is context- and project- specific and so MUST be defined in the
`README.md` included with the project.

At a minimum, the workflow information in the project `README.md` MUST detail
the following:

* Version control system specifics (eg. Git, Subversion).
* Branching model (eg. [git-flow][git-flow]).
* Pull Request policy (if the version control system used has this feature).
* Pre- and post-commit hooks used.
* Automated testing instructions.
* Issue tracking guidelines.
* Process for deployment to relevant environments.
* Details for each spritesheet used in the project (see _Spritesheets_ for
  specifics).
